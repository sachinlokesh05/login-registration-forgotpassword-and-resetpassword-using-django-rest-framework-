pymitter
========

Python port of the extended Node.js EventEmitter 2 approach providing
namespaces, wildcards and TTL.


Example
-------

::

    from pymitter import EventEmitter

    ee = EventEmitter()

    # decorator usage
    @ee.on("myevent")
    def handler1(arg):
        print "handler1 called with", arg

    # callback usage
    def handler2(arg):
        print "handler2 called with", arg
    ee.on("myotherevent", handler2)

    # emit
    ee.emit("myevent", "foo")
    # -> "handler1 called with foo"

    ee.emit("myotherevent", "bar")
    # -> "handler2 called with bar"
