This library provides password hashers for the hash schemes provided by passlib for
Djangos password hashing framework. Unlike passlibs ``passlib.apps.django``, it does not replace Djangos
password hashing framework but adds additional hashers to its built in framework.

Please see https://github.com/mathiasertl/django-hashers-passlib for more information and documentation.
